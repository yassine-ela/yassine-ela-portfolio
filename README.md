# yassine-ela-portfolio
I created my personal portfolio based on the following repository: https://github.com/ashutosh1919/masterPortfolio (https://ashutoshhathidara.com/#/projects). 
I made significant modifications to the user interfaces of  this template to customize it according to my needs. For instance, in the "Projects" section of the navigation bar, 
I replaced the cards with cards that showcase my projects with many images. Additionally, I added a modal to each card to display more information about each project.
I also modified the cards in the "Experience" and "Education" sections to tailor them to my own information and experiences, etc.
